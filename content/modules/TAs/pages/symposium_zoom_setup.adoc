3. Fill out the meeting information as below (see screenshot below): 
- *Topic*: Use your team name followed by DM CRP Symposium (ex. 84.51 – DM CRP Symposium)
- *When*: Monday, April 12, 2021. Select start time to be 2:30 PM ET so it is ready to start the Zoom room early. The Symposium will officially start at 3 PM ET. 
- *Duration*: Select 3 hours (2:30 PM – 5:30 PM ET to allow flexibility even though it should last from 3-5 PM). 
- *Meeting ID*: Select “Generate Automatically” to add additional layer of security. Do *not* select personal meeting room. 
- *Security*: Enable the passcode. 
- *Meeting Options*: Allow participants to join *15 minutes* before start time. Also select “mute participants upon entry” since people will be joining at any time between 3-5 PM so we don’t want them to interrupt the conversation.

== Setting changes to protect your meeting
Under Settings > In Meeting (Basic), turn *off* Annotation, Whiteboard, and Remote Control. This prevents Zoom “bombers” or others with malicious intent from taking over the meeting.

Under Settings > In Meeting (Advanced), turn off Far End camera control. Keep Virtual Background turned on so that guests and students can use a virtual background.
