== How to Provide Constructive Feedback

=== Tips 

* Use examples and observations in your feedback. Do not make assumptions. 
* Focus your feedback on areas the student can control and improve on (as opposed to identifying problems out of the student's control)
* Share recommendations and solutions for the problem you identify

=== Examples of Bad Constructive Feedback

* "You need to do better."
* "You need to talk more."


=== Examples of Good Constructive Feedback

* "You are reserved during team meetings, but we would value your insights. We encourage you to unmute and share your ideas more often. "
